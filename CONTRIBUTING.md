# Contributing to Chatter

I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Develop with Github

I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/recoskyler/chatter/blob/main/LICENSE)

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/recoskyler/chatter/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainer if that's a concern.

## Report bugs and feature requests using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/recoskyler/chatter/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report from [Brian A. Danielak](https://github.com/briandk), and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/recoskyler/chatter/blob/main/LICENSE) License.
